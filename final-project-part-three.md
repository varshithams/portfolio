# The final data story
This is my final [website](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/vms/plastic-pollution-in-ocean/index.html) for my topic " Plastic Pollution in Ocean".


# Changes made since Part II
During part II of my project, I had a few individuals regarding how my website is visually and how good of an impact it creates. Based on the review that I received I have made the changes. After going through a few more articles I felt like making a few more changes to my website.

### Marine animals affected by plastic:
I added a section where I can display those marine animals that are being affected by the plastics that we are throwing away. These animals include turtles, sea lions, sea birds, dolphins, and whales. This would create an impact on the user or awareness of those who were unaware of this

### Organisation is taking step towards the issue:
Oceana is one such organization that I came across when I was searching for any information regarding marine pollution. this is one such organization creating greater impact. They have won more than 300 victories and protected nearly 4 million square miles of ocean. I wanted to add this information so people who want to volunteer or even donate can do so and these users know where they can go to do so.

### Video on The Story of Plastic: 
I have watched plenty of videos on this marine pollutant and how this is affecting not just marine animals but humans as well who are the sole reason for the increased usage of plastic. One such YouTube video that I found shocking was "The Story of Plastic: Where Your Recycled Plastic Ends Up". I found out that the plastic that already exists is going nowhere it just keeps moving from one place to another. 

### Shifting to plastic-free
I wanted to add another visualization that tells an individual how much they can save a year if they start making plastic-free choices. So I got information from the Future Green website, which mentioned how much we can save if we use each plastic-free product. I wanted to visually represent this so using the data given on the website I created an Excel sheet and used that to represent it in Tableau. I used a heat map which says how much each product I helping us save and it is an easy-to-understand representation.


## The audience
The audience for this particular website would be the **general public** as most people in the world are involved in using plastic products in one way or the other. The message or call to action is for everybody who is using plastic products on why should we stop using them and the effects of plastics if we keep using them.
As my audience is the general public I made sure I kept all the details and information super simple and clear so it's easy to understand. Simple explanation with greater impact is something that I considered here as the audience can be anybody from kids to elder people and they should be able to understand everything. Keeping this in mind from part 1 itself, I have worked towards the project making sure it reaches everyone who visits the website.

I went ahead and checked with a few more people and took reviews on my website who are aware and some are unaware of the UNSDG goal associated with plastic issues.

**Person 1**: He is a MEM student in CMU, who is aware of UNSDG. 
He mentioned that he liked the way the story unfolded. Numbers did scare and mainly projection gives this story a strong point to be considered. Adding the organization that is already a part of and what the call to action is also mentioned simply and understandably. He also said this is more like a one-step to every piece of information. I can find why, what how, and when answers in just one website. In the part where I have mentioned how much money we shall save if we make plastic-free choices, the breakdown is very interesting, but he mentioned adding a few lines on how much will I be spending if I still stick to using plastic. So this way we shall have something to compare regarding costs. This made sense and I will be adding a few information on this as well.

I showed it to my parents, who are in their mid-50s and they are way too proud for some reason. They mentioned data wise it has a strong point and seriousness is drawn towards it. My dad being a National trainer said visualisation looks good and catchy. 


## Final design decisions
I have added more sections and kept the color coordinated for all these sections. For a heat map that I added, I chose to go with green color as it represents go green which is plastic-free and this is environment friendly. I have kept color throughout the website very coordinated and subtle. I also added a heat map in the end which indicated how much we save overall and that is why going plastic-free is the best choice. 

### Things that stood out for me
I love how I was able to visualize the graph which gradually shows the increase in plastic production and also the projection for 2035 if we keep using plastic this way. The way that the world map came out as well was impressive for me. The way I could use images to tell the story was something I was majorly focusing on and I am happy the way it came out.


# Final thoughts

When I started this particular project I took a lot of time in Part I and I feel that is the most time-consuming and crucial part. Deciding on which topic and going through the structure by imagining how I want to represent is very vital; when it comes to developing a website. Conveying the story is the most important thing here. So I took a lot of time to represent the structure as it will be easier in the future parts I just have to follow the steps and probably make minute changes as I proceed to make the website. There was no implementation here so maybe there was no limitation on what I wanted to represent so did the ideas flow.

In the second part, when I started representing the structure I wrote in part II, I found it good as I was just following the structure. My time went here for visualization on choosing how I want to represent the structure that I defined previously. The flow mattered here as I had to convey a story. I did state the problem first, a source on what causing this marine pollution, how much of an impact is it creating in numbers, and mainly how that is affecting us as well and not just the marine population. This will make users understand why this is a serious issue and it's high time we react. Now I have written how we should start taking action which is making plastic-free choices and if we do so how much we shall save. 
Taking interviews with individuals who are concerned about UNSDG, one being a person from the media helped me get a great insight on how I can make this website a better one. so I made the following changes in the third part.

In the third part, I added most of the changes mentioned like the marine animals being affected, organizations that are taking part already to address the issue, and how much money we can save by shifting to plastic-free using a heat map. This added more weight to my website.
