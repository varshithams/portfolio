# Outline
> 
In light of the escalating prevalence of microplastics within ocean ecosystems, my project seeks to illuminate the less explored dimensions of their impact, particularly on ecosystem functioning and the intricate dynamics at the lower trophic levels. The pervasive nature of microplastics and their documented effects on individual organisms and populations underscore a pressing environmental crisis. However, the broader implications on ecosystem functionality, especially the influence on the foundational elements of marine life such as microbial communities and primary productivity processes, remain largely enigmatic. My interest in this project stems from a profound concern over this serious issue, which not only jeopardizes marine biodiversity but also threatens the ecological balance and health of ocean ecosystems at large.
>
> Through this project, I aim to shed light on the critical yet underappreciated aspect of microplastic pollution â€” its capacity to alter the very fabric of oceanic life at the microbial level, with far-reaching consequences on the overall productivity and health of marine ecosystems. By unraveling the complex interactions and feedback mechanisms instigated by microplastics, this study aspires to contribute valuable insights to the scientific community, inform policy-making, and catalyze a broader public understanding of the urgent need to address microplastic pollution. The ultimate goal is to foster a more informed and concerted effort towards mitigating this grave environmental challenge, safeguarding marine biodiversity, and preserving the ocean's vital ecosystem services.

The first graph displays the concentrations of various types of microplastics in simulated marine environments called mesocosms. This study is crucial for understanding how these microplastic concentrations impact marine ecosystems and productivity.

The second graph illustrates the characteristics of repositories storing microplastic data and the study sites referenced in articles. This data helps us understand where microplastic research is conducted and how data is stored, aiding in identifying gaps and guiding future research and policy decisions.

These visualizations aim to complement the narrative outlined in the project structure, providing insights into microplastic concentrations and data repository characteristics to enhance understanding and inform decision-making regarding microplastic pollution.

# The data
The data for this project is sourced from two publicly available websites, which host datasets related to microplastic pollution research. Being publicly available, these datasets alleviate concerns regarding copyright issues. I plan to analyze these datasets to investigate microplastic concentrations in marine environments, understand their impact on ecosystem functioning, and assess trends in data sharing and accessibility within the microplastic research community. Through visualization and interpretation of these datasets, I aim to contribute insights into the current state of microplastic pollution research and inform strategies for addressing this environmental challenge.
