# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I am Varshitha Mysore Suresh (she/her). I know coding enough to be a geek and can also train you to speak.

Born to an engineering couple, one might say that the apple didn't fall too far away from the tree. I grew up with a fascination towards science and technology, and reached college with a will to be an engineer; the only hiccup was the confusion of what kind of engineer I wanted to be. That is when I dived into the ‘C’ of opportunities, and since then my life has become a code, constantly developing and consistently evolving. 

I graduated with a degree in computer science and a job at Deloitte, along with a bunch of projects that solidified my interest in the field. I worked for almost two years at Deloitte, with the most diverse and intelligent minds, gathered all the experience the MNC provided, worked with and for several international clients, earned an award for my contribution there and as I felt I was ready for the next step, I took the jump and landed on a Master’s in Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh USA. Deloitte was just the prologue; my story has only begun to shape, with Carnegie Mellon being the next ***pitstop!***

On the contrary side, the talker that I am compelled me to join Junior Chamber International, 
an International NGO of young people (18-40 age group) with members across 124 countries. I became a certified zonal trainer, providing personality development training that includes effective public speaking, soft skill development, and several other topics like these, for youth across different strata of the society. It's incredible how my natural inclination to talk could lead to being such an effective tool in my arsenal.

Deloitte was an eye-opener, Carnegie Mellon is the gate to bigger opportunities, and JCI is where I found my voice to face the world. So, here's to the apple that stayed close to the engineering tree, but dared to dream differently.

# What I hope to learn

1. Learn to create effective data visualizations using various tools and mediums.
2. Build a publicly accessible portfolio showcasing my work in data visualization.
3. Learn how to tailor narratives to suit specific target audiences.
4. And obviously learn how to tell stories with data!

   Post my graduation from CMU, I would like to pursue my career in the IT industry as a developer or data engineer.

## Data Visualization using Tableau

Tableau is a leading tool in data visualization, known for its user-friendly interface that caters to a range of users, from business analysts to data scientists. Its intuitive, drag-and-drop functionality simplifies the creation and understanding of complex data visualizations. One of Tableau's key strengths is its ability to handle large datasets efficiently, enabling the processing and visualization of substantial amounts of data quickly. This feature is particularly beneficial for big data applications and real-time data analysis.

Tableau offers a diverse array of visualization options, including various charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards. This versatility allows users to represent data in the most effective and insightful manner for their specific needs. The interactive dashboards are a standout feature, offering dynamic and engaging visualizations that users can interact with to explore data in greater depth. This interactivity includes capabilities like drilling down into details and filtering data.

Another significant advantage of Tableau is its robust data connectivity. It can integrate with a wide variety of data sources, such as SQL databases, cloud databases, spreadsheets, and even big data sources, facilitating comprehensive and multifaceted data analysis. Additionally, Tableau supports collaboration and sharing, making it easier for teams to work together on data analysis projects and share insights across the organization or with external stakeholders. This combination of features makes Tableau an invaluable tool in the realm of data visualization and business intelligence.
