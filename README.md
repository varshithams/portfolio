# Hey Everyone!
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
I am Varshitha Mysore Suresh (she/her). I know coding enough to be a geek and can also train you to speak.

Born to an engineering couple, one might say that the apple didn't fall too far away from the tree. I grew up with a fascination towards science and technology, and reached college with a will to be an engineer; the only hiccup was the confusion of what kind of engineer I wanted to be. That is when I dived into the ‘C’ of opportunities, and since then my life has become a code, constantly developing and consistently evolving. 

I graduated with a degree in computer science and a job at Deloitte, along with a bunch of projects that solidified my interest in the field. I worked for almost two years at Deloitte, with the most diverse and intelligent minds, gathered all the experience the MNC provided, worked with and for several international clients, earned an award for my contribution there and as I felt I was ready for the next step, I took the jump and landed on a Master’s in Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh USA. Deloitte was just the prologue; my story has only begun to shape, with Carnegie Mellon being the next ***pitstop!***

On the contrary side, the talker that I am compelled me to join Junior Chamber International, 
an International NGO of young people (18-40 age group) with members across 124 countries. I became a certified zonal trainer, providing personality development training that includes effective public speaking, soft skill development, and several other topics like these, for youth across different strata of the society. It's incredible how my natural inclination to talk could lead to being such an effective tool in my arsenal.

Deloitte was an eye-opener, Carnegie Mellon is the gate to bigger opportunities, and JCI is where I found my voice to face the world. So, here's to the apple that stayed close to the engineering tree, but dared to dream differently.

# What I hope to learn

1. Learn to create effective data visualizations using various tools and mediums.
2. Build a publicly accessible portfolio showcasing my work in data visualization.
3. Learn how to tailor narratives to suit specific target audiences.
4. And learn how to tell stories with data!

   Post my graduation from CMU, I would like to pursue my career in the IT industry as a developer or data engineer.

## What else do I do?

I indulge myself in [extracurricular activities](https://www.instagram.com/jci.mysore.brindhavan/).

## Data Visualization using Tableau

### 4 Data Visualization

 Utilizing the comprehensive dataset provided in [visualizing debt](visualizing-government-debt), I have crafted below <u>three</u> distinct data visualizations to elucidate various aspects of the data, each tailored to present specific insights effectively.

 The first visualization is a [Heat Map](heat-map). 

The second visualization is a [Bar Chart](bar-chart). 

Lastly, the [Area chart](area-chart) 

### Compare all 3 visualization

| Feature | Heat Map | Bar Chart | Area Chart |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Color Use** | Good for density, may be confusing if many data points | Distinct, easy differentiation of values | Gradual, shows trends without overwhelming |
| **Readability** | Can be cluttered with many values | Highly readable, clear distinction between data points | Clear trend visualization, less cluttered than heat map |
| **Eye Strain** | High density of data can strain eyes | Less strain, as bars are spaced and well-defined | Minimal strain, as data is spread and represented as continuous shapes |
| **Data Extraction** | Difficult to extract precise values due to color reliance | Easy to extract exact figures from bar height | Good for understanding overall trends and patterns |


## Other critiques

I also analyzed and critiqued " Who Americans spend their time by age" - [Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)](critique-by-design)
