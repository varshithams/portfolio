# About me
I am Varshitha Mysore Suresh (she/her). I know coding enough to be a geek and can also train you to speak.

Born to an engineering couple, one might say that the apple didn't fall too far away from the tree. I grew up with a fascination towards science and technology, and reached college with a will to be an engineer; the only hiccup was the confusion of what kind of engineer I wanted to be. That is when I dived into the ‘C’ of opportunities, and since then my life has become a code, constantly developing and consistently evolving. 

I graduated with a degree in computer science and a job at Deloitte, along with a bunch of projects that solidified my interest in the field. I worked for almost two years at Deloitte, with the most diverse and intelligent minds, gathered all the experience the MNC provided, worked with and for several international clients, earned an award for my contribution there and as I felt I was ready for the next step, I took the jump and landed on a Master’s in Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh USA. Deloitte was just the prologue; my story has only begun to shape, with Carnegie Mellon being the next ***pitstop!***

On the contrary side, the talker that I am compelled me to join Junior Chamber International, 
an International NGO of young people (18-40 age group) with members across 124 countries. I became a certified zonal trainer, providing personality development training that includes effective public speaking, soft skill development, and several other topics like these, for youth across different strata of the society. It's incredible how my natural inclination to talk could lead to being such an effective tool in my arsenal.

Deloitte was an eye-opener, Carnegie Mellon is the gate to bigger opportunities, and JCI is where I found my voice to face the world. So, here's to the apple that stayed close to the engineering tree, but dared to dream differently.

# What I hope to learn

1. Learn to create effective data visualizations using various tools and mediums.
2. Build a publicly accessible portfolio showcasing my work in data visualization.
3. Learn how to tailor narratives to suit specific target audiences.
4. And obviously learn how to tell stories with data!

   Post my graduation from CMU, I would like to pursue my career in the IT industry as a developer or data engineer.

## Data Visualization using Tableau

Tableau is a leading tool in data visualization, known for its <span style="color:blue">user-friendly</span> interface that caters to a range of users, from business analysts to data scientists. Its intuitive, drag-and-drop functionality <span style="color:blue">simplifies</span> the creation and understanding of complex data visualizations. One of Tableau's key strengths is its ability to handle <span style="color:blue">large datasets</span> efficiently, enabling the processing and visualization of substantial amounts of data quickly. This feature is particularly beneficial for big data applications and real-time data analysis.

Tableau offers a diverse array of <span style="color:blue">visualization options</span>, including various charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards. This versatility allows users to represent data in the most effective and insightful manner for their specific needs. The interactive dashboards are a standout feature, offering dynamic and engaging visualizations that users can interact with to explore data in greater depth. This interactivity includes capabilities like drilling down into details and filtering data.

Another significant advantage of Tableau is its robust <span style="color:blue">data connectivity</span>. It can integrate with a wide variety of data sources, such as SQL databases, cloud databases, spreadsheets, and even big data sources, facilitating comprehensive and multifaceted data analysis. Additionally, Tableau supports <span style="color:blue">collaboration and sharing</span>, making it easier for teams to work together on data analysis projects and share insights across the organization or with external stakeholders. This combination of features makes Tableau an invaluable tool in the realm of data visualization and business intelligence.


## 4 data Visualization

1. Utilizing the comprehensive dataset provided in [visualizing debt](visualizing-government-debt), I have crafted below <u>three</u> distinct data visualizations to elucidate various aspects of the data, each tailored to present specific insights effectively.

2. The first visualization is a [Heat Map](heat-map). This method is particularly adept at showcasing the concentration of values across two dimensions, allowing for a quick comparison across categories and time. In this instance, the Heat Map vividly highlights the differences in values across various locations over a series of years, with color intensities reflecting the magnitude of the data points. This visualization is instrumental in identifying trends and outliers at a glance.

3. I have used a bar chart and area chart here. I wanted to explore both these visual representations using tableau.
The second visualization is a [Bar Chart](bar-chart). Bar Charts are exceptionally useful for comparing quantitative data across different categories. The bars provide a clear visual representation of the data, making it easy to compare the relative size of the values they represent. In our case, the Bar Chart allows for an immediate comparative analysis of the values across different countries, presenting a straightforward view of the numerical data that would be less discernible in a textual format.

Lastly, the [Area chart](area-chart) serves a strategic purpose. By displaying quantities over time, it not only shows the magnitude of the values but also allows for the understanding of the progression and trends across time. The stacking of data points provides a sense of the cumulative effect of the values, making it particularly useful for visualizing the data that accumulates over time. This visualization emphasizes the growth or decline in values across different locations over the years, offering a comprehensive view of the data's trajectory.

### Compare all 3 visualization

| Feature | Heat Map | Bar Chart | Area Chart |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Color Use** | Good for density, may be confusing if many data points | Distinct, easy differentiation of values | Gradual, shows trends without overwhelming |
| **Readability** | Can be cluttered with many values | Highly readable, clear distinction between data points | Clear trend visualization, less cluttered than heat map |
| **Eye Strain** | High density of data can strain eyes | Less strain, as bars are spaced and well-defined | Minimal strain, as data is spread and represented as continuous shapes |
| **Data Extraction** | Difficult to extract precise values due to color reliance | Easy to extract exact figures from bar height | Good for understanding overall trends and patterns |


The choice of a [Bar Chart](bar-chart) for the final visualization was made to allow precise comparisons of specific values across different categories, which is particularly effective in revealing the exact figures for each location and year. Bar charts are universally understood and show clear delineations between data points, making them ideal for emphasizing individual data points against others.

The [Area chart](area-chart) was selected to represent the data as it excels in showing how values develop over time, with the ability to represent both the individual data points and their cumulative effect. This gives a more holistic view of the data's progression, making it suitable for visualizing extended trends and providing a clear indication of growth or decline over the period in question.

Both visualizations were deemed appropriate for their respective strengths: the bar chart for its precise, comparative capabilities, and the area chart for its effective display of trends and cumulative data, providing complementary perspectives on the dataset.

## Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
I chose to redesign [Who do we spend time with across our lifetime?](https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime) which I found on [makeovermonday](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) website.

Using the [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) (DVEP) to evaluate the line chart depicting how Americans spend their time with various groups across different ages provides a structured approach to critique its utility and design. The DVEP's multi-dimensional evaluation criteria—covering usefulness, completeness, perceptibility, truthfulness, intuitiveness, aesthetics, and engagement—allow for a comprehensive assessment beyond subjective measures.

By using the DVEP, I can affirm that the visualization effectively communicates valuable information for the stakeholders(usefulness). Upon applying the DVEP, it becomes apparent that relational nuances—such as the quality of interactions or the context of 'alone' time—are not captured. Adding layers of data that provide context to the 'alone' time, such as whether it is by choice or circumstance, would give a richer understanding of the data(completeness). In terms of perceptibility, the chart is well-designed with clear, distinguishable lines. However, the DVEP highlights the potential for improvement in the representation of overlapping data points.

The truthfulness criterion within the DVEP ensures the data's accuracy and reliability. The visualization appears to meet this standard, but the DVEP prompts questions about the potential for oversimplification. For example, does the representation of time with children versus with family appropriately differentiate between the two, or is there an overlap that isn't addressed?

The chart scores high on intuitiveness for those familiar with line graphs, but the DVEP suggests that additional guidance could be beneficial for novice users. Aesthetically, the visualization is clean and not overburdened with excessive elements, aligning with the DVEP's emphasis on simplicity. However, it points out the need for a more cohesive color scheme that aids those with color vision deficiencies and improves overall legibility. Lastly, in terms of engagement, the chart tells a compelling story that invites further inquiry, aligning with the DVEP's criteria.

While line charts are suitable for this data, I would explore the use of an [area chart with clusters](area-chart-with-clusters) to represent the cumulative time spent with different people.
