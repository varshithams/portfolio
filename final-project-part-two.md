# Wireframes / storyboards

I had written a detailed project structure in part one which helped me with the flow of the website. With each part, I wrote a description of the research, and study I was inspired by and added relevant images.
Using Shorthand, I designed the visual elements of the site, choosing a color scheme and layout that reflected the serious tone of the subject matter. I made sure that the visualizations were interactive where possible, such as hovering over graphs, and navigation that reveal more information upon interaction, to keep users engaged.
I then integrated the data from the datasets into Tableau, creating the visualizations that would be embedded into the website.

This is the [website](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/vms/plastic-pollution-in-ocean/index.html) I created on "Plastic Pollution in Ocean."

# User research 

## Target audience

I decided to reach out to these people I know who have backgrounds closer to such issues as well as to someone who might be not as invested but would like to know about the issue. This way I can get feedback from different perspectives.

First I interviewed my friend who is doing his MA in Communication and Media, mid 20's. He is currently doing his study on UNSDG goals and I felt he would be perfect to interview as he has prior knowledge about the issue.

Second I interviewed one who is in MISM-BIDA CMU, mid 20's who has knowledge about UNSDG and was concerned about the pollution.

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How familiar are you with the issue of plastic pollution in the ocean? | Familiar | Somewhat Familiar  |             |
| What do you think are the ocean's primary sources of plastic pollution? |   Industrial wastes | sewage dumped into the ocean with no proper treatment            |             |
| How concerned are you about the impact of plastic pollution on marine life and ecosystems? |  I am quite concerned about the pollution that might cause a natural imbalance in the ecosystem which may lead to catastrophic consequences for human life as well | I feel very sad that the usage of plastic is exponentially high which is not only affecting them but also the marine life as we dump them without thinking twice.            |             |
|Is the microplastic effect on organisms or humans conveyed through my presentation?  |  Yes it does. There was quite a lot of information on the website.| Yes. The way  the visuals are used to demonstrate the impact is eye-catching which makes me dive deep into the effect the plastic is causing  |             |
| What was the surprising element about plastic pollution on the website? | 17.6 billion pounds of plastic waste is dumped in the ocean every year which is surprising and sad at the same time.| I was surprised that only 9% of plastic is recycled annually. With people always talking just about recycling it felt like that's the best solution we have towards plastic, but through the website, I got to know well its not.     |     |
| What were the instances in the presentation that attracted your attention to the issue? | Projection, 9% of plastic being recycled   | 17.6 billion pounds being dumped, projection of 2035   |  |
| Do you feel a personal connection or responsibility to address the issue of plastic pollution? |Yes of course. Especially given the numbers and projects that this plastic pollution can lead this world to, a sense of responsibility certainly has been induced within me | Yes I feel like as humans we have a huge responsibility towards the issue | |
|How would you rate the user experience and design of our website, including navigation, layout, and visual appeal?|10/10. Curated information is very convenient to understand what I am reading and paints a clear picture of the danger. coordinated colors on the website make it an attractive visual experience.  | 10/10 on visual appeal, 9/10 for navigation because I feel like having them on the left side makes it more comfortable  | |
|What specific changes or additions would you suggest to make the website a more effective tool in the fight against plastic pollution in the ocean? | The number of endangered species that die in the ocean because of plastic can be added | What current organizations are doing to address this? Is the government doing anything? Add videos and a discussion forum to make it more engaging |   |
 


# Identified changes for Part III


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Endangered animals                       | The number of endangered species that die in the ocean because of plastic       |
| Other organization/discussion forum      | What current organizations are doing to address this? Is the government doing anything? Add videos and a discussion forum to make it more engaging                                                                                |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|            |                                                                                 |

Post discussion I also realized I could add global visualization where I can highlight regions that are mostly affected by plastic pollution in the ocean.
