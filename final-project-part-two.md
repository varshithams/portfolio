# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

| How concerned are you about the impact of plastic pollution on marine life and ecosystems? |  I am quite concerned about the pollution that might cause a natural imbalance in the ecosystem which may lead to catastrophic consequences for human life as well |             |             |
|Is the microplastic effect on organisms or humans conveyed through my presentation?  |  Yes it does. There was quite a lot of information on the website.|            |             |
| Which was the surprising element about plastic pollution on the website? | 17.6 billion pounds of plastic waste is dumped in the ocean every year which is surprising and sad at the same time.|      |     |

|How would you rate the user experience and design of our website, including navigation, layout, and visual appeal?|10/10. Curated information is very convenient to understand what I am reading and paints a clear picture of the danger. coordinated colors on the website make it an attractive visual experience.  | | |
