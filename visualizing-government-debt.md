The chart is likely designed to allow for an easy comparison of debt levels relative to the size of each country's economy, which is a key indicator of the sustainability of government finance. The highlighted bar in black could indicate a specific country of interest or a benchmark for comparison. This type of visualization is helpful for quickly identifying which countries have higher or lower government debt relative to their GDP, making it a useful tool for economists, policymakers, and researchers interested in international fiscal comparisons.

I have represented this data in [heat map](heat-map), [Area chart](area-chart), and [Bar chart](bar-chart).
